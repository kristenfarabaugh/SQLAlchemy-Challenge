## Background of Analysis:  
You've decided to treat yourself to a long holiday vacation in Honolulu, Hawaii. To help with your trip planning, you decide to do a climate analysis about the area. The following sections outline the steps that you need to take to accomplish this task.

## Part 1: Analyze and Explore the Climate Data
In this section, I used Python, SQL Alchemy, Pandas and Matplotlib to conduct basic exploration and analysis of the climate database. I conducted analysis on precipitation over time as well as station specific analysis (how many there were, which was most active, etc)

## Part 2: Design Your Climate App
I designed a Flask API to make the data usable / accessible to to the end user.
